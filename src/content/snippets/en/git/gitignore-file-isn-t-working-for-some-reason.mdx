The files/folder in your version control will not just delete themselves just because you added them to the&nbsp;`.gitignore`. They are already in the repository and you have to remove them. You can just do that with this:

**Remember to commit everything you've changed before you do this!**

```bash
git rm -rf --cached .
git add .

```

This removes all files from the repository and adds them back (this time respecting the rules in your&nbsp;`.gitignore`).
