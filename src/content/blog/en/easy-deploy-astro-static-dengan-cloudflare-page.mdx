[Astro](http://astro.build) is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. By default, Astro builds websites that have zero JavaScript runtime code.

## Multi-Page Application (MPA)

A Multi-Page Application (MPA) represents an intricate web architecture, encompassing multiple HTML pages predominantly served from a centralized server. Each time a user navigates to a different page, the browser sends a request to the server to fetch the corresponding HTML page. One prominent exemplar of an MPA framework is Astro.

Additionally, traditional MPA frameworks comprise well-established platforms such as Ruby on Rails, Python Django, PHP Laravel, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, as well as static site builders like Eleventy or Hugo.

## Embracing the Server-First Approach

Astro embraces a server-side rendering approach, aligning with established practices of traditional server-side frameworks like PHP, WordPress, Laravel, and Ruby on Rails.

This eliminates the need to master a secondary server-side language, as Astro maintains the simplicity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript).

In contrast, modern JavaScript web frameworks like Next.js, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Remix, and others primarily rely on client-side rendering, using server-side rendering for performance optimization.

While this Single Page App (SPA) model offers advantages, it introduces complexity and performance tradeoffs that negatively impact page performance, especially for content-centric websites where swift first-load performance is crucial.

# Benefits of Deploying Static Sites with Cloudflare Pages

Deploying static sites with Cloudflare Pages offers several significant benefits, making it an attractive choice for website hosting and delivery:

-   **Lightning-Fast Performance**: Cloudflare Pages leverages Cloudflare's global content delivery network (CDN) to serve your static site from multiple edge locations worldwide. This reduces latency and ensures that visitors experience rapid page loading times, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

# Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

-   Possess a GitHub or other Source Code Management (SCM) account.
-   Have an account on [cloudflare.com](http://cloudflare.com).
-   Already have an Astro project, ready for deployment.

_If you don't have one yet, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial to [create a blog](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)_.

## Deploying with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Cloudflare Pages, follow these steps:[^2]

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
2. In Account Home, navigate to **Workers & Pages** > **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.

![Create application](@/assets/blog/easy-deploy-astro-static-dengan-cloudflare-page/create-application.png 'Create application')

3. If you haven't done so already, authorize Cloudflare to access your GitHub account.

![Save & Deploy ](@/assets/blog/easy-deploy-astro-static-dengan-cloudflare-page/save-and-deploy.png 'Save & Deploy ')

4. This access is essential for Cloudflare to monitor and deploy your projects from the source. If you prefer, you can restrict access to specific repositories; however, you'll need to manually update this list within your GitHub settings when adding more repositories to Cloudflare Pages.

5. Select the newly created GitHub repository and, in the Set up builds and deployments section, provide the required information.
