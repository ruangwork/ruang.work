We will explore how to group data using `reduce()` in JavaScript arrays. We will use the following code example:

```javascript
const challenges = [
    {
        title: "Age Calculator App",
        type: "app",
    },
    {
        title: "Drawer",
        type: "components",
    },
]

let challenges = challenges
    .filter((content) => content.status)
    .reduce((acc, curr) => {
        // find the index of the object with the appropriate type
        const index = acc.findIndex((obj) => obj.type === curr.type)

        // if an object of that type doesn't already exist, add a new object
        if (index === -1) {
            acc.push({ type: curr.type, contents: [curr] })
        }
        // if an object of that type already exists, add the data to the existing array
        else {
            acc[index]["contents"].push(curr)
        }

        return acc
    }, [])

```

The code above will group the challenges data based on the type of each challenge. The output is an \_**array of objects**\_ that contains the type of challenge and the content of each challenge that has the same type.

The grouping result will look like this,

```javascript
;[
	{
		type: 'app',
		contents: [{ title: 'title', type: 'app' }],
	},
	{
		type: 'components',
		contents: [{ title: 'title', type: 'components' }],
	},
]
```

In the example above, the `filter()` method is used to remove objects that have a **status** of `false`. Then, the **reduce()** method is used to group the challenges objects by type.

At each **iteration**, we search the index of objects with the same type using the **findIndex()** method. If an object of that type does not exist, we add a new object of that type and **the initial contents of the contents array is the object being processed**. If an object of that type already exists, we add the contents of the object being processed to the existing **array contents**.

For example, if we have an array of challenges as follows:

```
const challenges = [
    { title: "Age Calculator App", type: "app" },
    { title: "Weather App", type: "app" },
    { title: "Basic Calculator", type: "app" },
]

```

So, after running the above code, the output is as follows:

```
[
  {
    type: 'app',
    contents: [
      { title: 'Age Calculator App', type: 'app' },
      { title: 'Weather App', type: 'app' },
      { title: 'Basic Calculator', type: 'app' },
    ],
  },
]
```

In the above example, all challenge objects have the same type **'app'**, so one object of that type and the contents of each challenge are generated. However, if we have objects with different types, they will be grouped into different objects.

By using the **reduce()** method, we can easily group data in Javascript arrays effectively and efficiently.
