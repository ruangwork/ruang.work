Cronjob is a feature in operating systems or cloud services that allows us to run a task at a specified time on a scheduled basis.

In this article, we will discuss how to create a cronjob in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to run a trigger deploy hook task.

## What is Deploy Hook?

Deploy Hook is a URL that we can use to trigger the process of deploying applications on cloud services such as [Vercel](vercel.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). By using the Deploy Hook, we can ensure that every time we push to the main branch of the Git repository, our application will be deployed automatically.

However, sometimes we want to deploy manually, for example if we have made changes to the application configuration or want to deploy to a different environment. In such cases, we can use a cronjob to trigger the Deploy Hook and start the deploy process manually.

## Setting up Environment Variable

You can create `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` by following vercel's tutorial [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/deploy-hooks).

Before we start creating a cronjob on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we need to set up an environment variable to store the Deploy Hook URL. Here are the steps to set up the environment variable:

1. Open the `.env.local` file in our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
1. Add the following line to the file:

```javascript
DEPLOY_HOOK_URL=https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj***
```

Ensure that the `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` value is populated with the correct Deploy Hook URL.

## Create API to Trigger Deploy Hook

After the environment variables have been set up, next we will create an API to trigger the Deploy Hook in Vercel. Here is an example API implementation for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using TypeScript that handles errors and some other possibilities:

```javascript
import { NextApiHandler } from 'next'
import axios from 'axios'

const deployHookUrl = process.env.DEPLOY_HOOK_URL

const handler: NextApiHandler = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    if (!deployHookUrl) {
      throw new Error('Deploy hook url is not set.')
    }

    const response = await axios.post(deployHookUrl)

    if (response.status === 200) {
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Deployment started.' })
    } else {
      throw new Error('Failed to trigger deployment.')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)

    let errorMessage = 'Server error.'

    if (error.response && error.response.data) {
      errorMessage = error.response.data.message
    } else if (error.message) {
      errorMessage = error.message
    }

    res.status(500).json({ message: errorMessage })
  }
}

export default handler
```

In the example above, we use `process.env.DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` to retrieve the Deploy Hook URL that has been stored in the `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` environment variable. Then, we ensure that the environment variable value is not empty or `null` before making a POST request to the Vercel Deploy Hook. If the value of the `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` environment variable is empty or `null`, we will throw an error with the message "Deploy hook url is not set.".

In this case, it is important to ensure that the value of the `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` environment variable is set and matches the Deploy Hook URL we want to use.

## Configure Vercel Cron Jobs

Next, after creating the API to trigger the Deploy Hook in Vercel, we need to set up a cron job so that the API can be run on a scheduled basis. Here is an example of a cron configuration from Vercel that can be set in the `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
	"crons": [
		{
			"path": "/api/cron",
			"schedule": "0 0 1-31/2 * *"
		}
	]
}
```

In the example above, we created a cron job that will run the API on the `/api/cron` path every odd date (1, 3, 5, ... 31) at 00:00. We can change the configuration of this cron job as needed.

base on vercel cronjob [article](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs#cron-expressions). here some config.

```bash
# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (0 is Sunday, 6 is Saturday)
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * *
```

| expressions    | Description                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `* * * * *`    | Triggers every minute                   |
| `*/10 * * * *` | Triggers every ten minutes              |
| `0 * * * *`    | Triggers at the beginning of every hour |
| `0 3 * * *`    | Triggers every day at 3:00 am           |
| `10 5 * * 0`   | Triggers every Sunday at 5:10 am        |

By using a cron job and API to trigger the Deploy Hook in Vercel, we can make the application deployment process easier and more scheduled.

In addition, by utilizing these features, we can focus more on developing our applications and avoid monotonous and time-consuming manual processes.
